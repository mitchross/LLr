##End of the Internet app (Android only)
###Working title: _LLr_

######Install instructions
* Install Android Studio
* Make sure SDK is updated (I have to run AS as an admin and go to the SDK manager through tools on my machine)
* Build project, it should build without anything crazy because Gradle manages dependencies

######What works
Logging in, topic list.

######What doesn't work
Everything else
